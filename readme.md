# Chord Frequency Mapper
##Aidan Taylor. 2018.

I made this project to leard a bit more about Python 3, I wanted to learn about generating, importing and exporting data. It's a basic tool, but it is functional.

Download or clone this repository and run the program with:

```
python3 main.py
```

It doesn't have any dependencies.

--- 

When you run main.py for the first time, a CSV file will be generated that lists all MIDI notes between A0 and C8, by name, number and frequency.

The CSV file is then accessed by a couple of functions based on the user input - I hope the program is self explanatory beyond this. 

I am learning, and would very much appreciate any feedback you have to give!

You are free to use this code as you wish.
